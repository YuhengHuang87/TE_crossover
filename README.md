# TE_crossover
 
There are four folders containing scripts for performing these analyses:
  1. Call SNP and identify CO in Illumina benchmark data
  2. Identify CO in PacBio pool-seq data
  3. In silico exploration of identifying CO with the pool-seq approach
  4. Test the impact of TEs on local CO 

The breakpoints of the crossover events identified by the long-read pool-sequencing approach in A6 and A7 crosses are in A6_cross_output.txt and A7_cross_output.txt.

The analyses correspond to the Figures 1 & 2, and all the supplementary Figures & Tables. They were performed at the HPC3 cluster at UC-Irvine.
