# TE_crossover
 
There are four folders containing scripts for performing these analyses:
  1. Call SNP and identify CO in Illumina benchmark data
  2. Identify CO in PacBio pool-seq data
  3. In silico exploration of identifying CO with the pool-seq approach
  4. Test the impact of TEs on local CO 

They were performed at the HPC3 cluster at UC-Irvine.
